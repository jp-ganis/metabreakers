	<br />
	The way we calculate Metabreaker.to scores is as follows:
	<br />
	<br />
	
	<font size='4'>
		-- -- 1) First we pick a <font color=#33F7DB>faction</font>.
		<br />
		
		-- -- 2) For each player who has played that <font color=#33F7DB>faction</font>, we calculate their average rankings score on all <font color=#33F7DB><i>other</i></font> factions.
		<br />
		-- -- 3) For that <font color=#33F7DB>faction</font>, what is the average rankings scored by all <font color=#e07f7b><i>other</i></font> players on that <font color=#33F7DB>faction</font>. 
		<br />
	</font>
		
	<br />
	We then calculate the <font color=#33F7DB>ratio</font> between those two numbers. If someone scores on average of <font color=#e07f7b>60</font> rankings points playing <font color=#33F7DB>Gitz</font>,
	but the average score for everyone else playing <font color=#33F7DB>Gitz</font> is <font color=#e07f7b>50</font>,
	then that player gets <font color=#e07f7b>+120</font> added to their rankings, because <font color=#e07f7b>60</font> is <font color=#e07f7b>120%</font> of <font color=#e07f7b>50</font>.
	
	<br />
	<br />
	Their score in the ladder is then the <font color=#33F7DB>average score</font> from their best <font color=#33F7DB>3</font> metabreakers events.
	
	<br />
	<br />
	<font size='2'>
	<i>Some top players in the rankings might have a low metabreaker score because the armies they play are doing well for everyone. And some low ranked players will have a 
	high metabreaker score, because although they don't do that well overall, they are still outperforming compared to how well everyone else is doing on their factions.</i>
