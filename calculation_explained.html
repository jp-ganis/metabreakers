	The way we calculate Metabreaker.to scores is as follows:
	<br />
	<br />
	
	-- First we pick a faction.
	<br />
	
	-- -- For each player who has played that faction, we calculate their average rankings score on all <i>other</i> factions.
	<br />
	-- -- For that faction, what is the average rankings scored by all players <i>other</i> than the one we're examining. 
	<br />
	
	<br />
	We then just calculate the difference between those two numbers. If someone scores on average of 60 rankings points playing Gitz,
	but the average score for everyone else playing Gitz is 50,
	then that player gets a +10 for their score.
	
	<br />
	<br />
	Their score in the ladder is then the average across all the factions they play. 
	
	<br />
	<br />
	Some top players in the rankings might have a low metabreaker score because the armies they play are doing well for everyone. And some low ranked players will have a 
	high metabreaker score, because although they don't do that well overall, they are still outperforming compared to how well everyone else is doing on their factions.
